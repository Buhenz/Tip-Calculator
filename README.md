# Tip-Calculator

Program done entirely by me, idea taken from www.frontendmentor.io

# How it works?

After entering the amount of the bill, we can choose the amount of the tip, or enter it ourselves (maximum 999), and we can enter the number of people on how many people the bill will be divided, then it shows us how much total bill to pay, and, if we have selected a tip, how much each person individually will pay extra tip

# What next?

I would like to try in a while to shorten some of the functions used in the code, because at times the code was very duplicated, and I was not able at this point of learning to write it in a more efficient way√≥

# What have I learned in this project?

I learned how to read technical documentation, how to improve code, how to troubleshoot when something wasn't working

# What made me most of the problems?

The biggest problem for me was to create this program in such a way that always the results of the bill, and the result of the tip changes "live."

# A few words from me

This is my first project using JavaScript, I'm learning it soon, it's my 2nd month of learning, I realize it's not a complicated program, but I've spent nearly 40 hours on it and I hope they gave me something more than just dry watching tutorials
